# Leadwerks5Template
This is a bare bones project setup for Leadwerks 5. It's configured so multiple projects can be developed using the same Engine/Libs. 

## To Install
1.  Clone the repo to anywhere on your disk.
2.  Copy the "Include" and "Libs" folders and paste it into "Source/Engine"   
3.  You can use "genertate_testapp.bat" to generate a simple app using the engine.
4.  Once that builds, copy the dlls from the SDK and paste it into the newly created project folder under "Projects"


## Notes
- Engine is still in beta, so things might change.
- Release still takes a hell of a long time to build.
- No 64f configurations at this time. I think this should be it's own configuration.
